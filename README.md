# Vincent Cheong's Portfolio Website

## Overview
This is my personal portfolio website, built to showcase projects, skills, and interests in an interactive and engaging way.  
It serves as a creative expression beyond a traditional resume, providing insight into both technical expertise and personal interests.

## Technologies Used
- **React** â€“ Frontend framework for building dynamic user interfaces  
- **Next.js** â€“ Framework for server-side rendering and static site generation  
- **react-three-fiber** â€“ Library for integrating 3D graphics using Three.js  
- **Tailwind CSS** â€“ Utility-first CSS framework for styling and layout  

## Challenges Faced
- **Learning Web Development** â€“ This was one of my first web development projects, requiring me to learn the fundamentals of React and Next.js from scratch.  
- **Integrating Libraries** â€“ Understanding how to implement react-three-fiber for 3D elements and styled-components for better UI design was initially challenging.  
- **Getting Started** â€“ I relied on multiple tutorials to figure out how to set up my first React project, structure components properly, and optimize performance.  

## Features I'm Proud Of
- **3D Visuals** â€“ Near the bottom of the website, I implemented interactive 3D elements using react-three-fiber, adding a visually appealing touch to the experience.  
- **Smooth UI/UX** â€“ Leveraging Tailwind CSS, the website maintains a clean and modern design, ensuring ease of navigation.  

## Future Improvements
- Adding more animations to enhance the user experience and give it a more modern feel. 
- Implementing more interactive elements, such as a movable map, to further enhance engagement.
